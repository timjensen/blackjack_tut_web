<h1>The magic partials</h1>
<p>
  Ok we just looked at our first javascript file and we now understand that a few pretials are required 
  to complete the deal action, these partials will also be used after the actions we are yet to look at.
  The first partial we will look at is the results partial so go ahead and create the _results.html.erb
  file in your views/games directory and enter the following:
</p>
<div id="cmd" class="span9">
<pre>
&lt;% flash.each <span class="g">do</span> <span class="b">|key, value|</span> %>
  <span class="br">&lt;div class=</span><span class="gr">"alert alert-&lt;%= key %>"</span><span class="br">></span>&lt;%= value %><span class="br">&lt;/div></span>
&lt;% <span class="g">end</span> %>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  This partial should look fimiliar as it was used in Hartl's tutorial on most our forms to display error and success 
  messages, in my original project I hard coded alot of result variables and formated div for different response so basically a page of coding 
  can be reduced to a few lines using flash calls. The next partial we will code will be the partial that contains the players cards and score.
  So go ahead and create the _players_cards.html.erb file in your views/games directory:
</p>
<div id="cmd" class="span9">
<pre>
&lt;% for card in session[<span class="r">:player_hand</span>].cards %>
  &lt;%= image_tag <span class="gr">"cards/#{card.card_front}.png"</span>  %>
&lt;% <span class="g">end</span> %>
&lt;%= label <span class="r">:players_hand</span>,<span class="gr">"Players Score: #{session[:player_hand].score}"</span> %>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  So the players cards partial takes the player hand session variable and using the cards array with in the hand
  loops through displaying each card using a image tag popluated with a url dynamically set using card front values.
  The last little bit simple sets a label displaying the players score from once again from the players hand session variable.
